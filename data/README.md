## Dataset formats

The dataset is available in its raw format (JSON) and pre-processed for FAIRSEQ models. In the latter case, sources (input reviews) and targets (summaries) are in separate files. Reviews in the source files are separated by a special symbol. JSON raw files contain not only reviews and summaries but also additional meta information, which can be useful for summarization. FAIRSEQ formatted files can be used to train FAIRSEQ models if they are binarized beforehand. For binarization instructions, please refer to the [preprocessing folder](../preprocessing).
